        "supplement": "A recent scientific study illustrating the increasing role of photosynthesis under global warming scenarios has been misconstrued to promote climate change denialism. In a November 18th Twitter post, Steve Milloy inaccurately claims the Earth is not warming as predicted by climate models because plant photosynthesis will absorb more CO2 than imagined. Milloy has ties to and defended the tobacco, chemical, and oil and gas industries for years; he considers climate change to be a hoax. His claims are based on his understanding of the study and a November 17th Telegraph article covering the study and have reached over 1.1 million viewers on Twitter."

But the temperature change over the last 150 years could mostly be due to coming out of the little ice age that lasted from 1200 to 1850. Mankind’s effect is likely a small part of this recent warming and an artifact of Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect.",

Alongside this claim, they posted a graph showing ice ages and supposed temperature anomalies over the last 400,000 years. To date, the post itself has been shared over 2,200 times. But this isn’t the first time the graph they shared has been used to ‘question’ climate change. On 28 December 2023, known climate misinformer Steve Milloy shared the same graph on X/Twitter to question CO2’s influence on Earth’s temperatures"

Stew Peters, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), suggested that Milton's path and development might be the result of weather manipulation. He referenced four past storms originating in the western Gulf of Mexico and heading toward Tampa Bay—three from the 19th century and one, Tropical Storm Henri, from 2003—to argue that Milton's trajectory is an unusual case."
