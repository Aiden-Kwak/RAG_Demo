Claim: Earth not warming as predicted by (junk) climate models because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO2 than imagined. Climate change is a hoax.

Fact-check Result: ### Claim Evaluation:
This claim is **inaccurate** and **misleading**.

### Reasoning:
The claim that "Earth not warming as predicted by (junk) climate models because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO2 than imagined" is not supported by scientific evidence. While it is true that increased CO2 levels can enhance plant photosynthesis (a phenomenon known as CO2 fertilization), this effect is limited and does not negate the overall warming trend predicted by climate models. 

1. **Limitations of CO2 Fertilization**: The IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5째C (2018) highlights that while elevated CO2 can increase plant growth, this effect is constrained by factors such as nutrient availability (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), water stress, and temperature changes. These limitations mean that the terrestrial carbon sink cannot indefinitely offset rising CO2 emissions (IPCC, 2018, p. 234).

2. **Net Carbon Sink Reduction**: The same report notes that climate change is projected to reduce the carbon sink expected under CO2 increase alone. This is due to factors like increased decomposition rates, wildfires, and land-use changes, which can release stored carbon back into the atmosphere (IPCC, 2018, p. 234).

3. **Climate Models Are Reliable**: The claim that climate models are "junk" is unfounded. Climate models have been extensively validated against historical data and have consistently demonstrated their ability to predict global temperature trends. The IPCC report emphasizes that climate models are robust tools for understanding and projecting climate change (IPCC, 2018, p. 187).

4. **Climate Change Is Not a Hoax**: The overwhelming consensus among climate scientists, as reflected in the IPCC reports and numerous peer-reviewed studies, is that climate change is real, primarily driven by human activities, and poses significant risks to ecosystems and human societies.

### Evidence:
- **IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5째C (2018), p. 234**: "The projected net effect of climate change is to reduce the carbon sink expected under CO2 increase alone."
- **IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5째C (2018), p. 187**: "Climate models are robust tools for understanding and projecting climate change."
- **IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5째C (2018), p. 234**: "Nitrogen, phosphorus and other nutrients will limit the terrestrial carbon cycle response to both elevated CO2 and altered climate."

### Conclusion:
The claim that Earth is not warming as predicted because plants are absorbing more CO2 than imagined is inaccurate and misleading. While increased CO2 can enhance plant growth, this effect is limited by various factors and does not counteract the overall warming trend. Climate models are reliable and have consistently predicted global warming, which is supported by extensive scientific evidence. Climate change is a well-documented phenomenon, and the assertion that it is a hoax is not supported by the scientific community.
