Claim: Earth not warming as predicted by (junk) climate models because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO2 than imagined. Climate change is a hoax.

Fact-check Result: - This claim is **inaccurate**.
- Because the claim that "Earth not warming as predicted by (junk) climate models because plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO2 than imagined" is not supported by scientific evidence. While it is true that plants absorb CO2 through photosynthesis, this process alone cannot offset the significant increase in atmospheric CO2 levels caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. Climate models, which are based on extensive scientific research, have consistently shown that the Earth is warming due to increased greenhouse gas emissions. The claim that climate change is a "hoax" is also contradicted by the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists and extensive peer-reviewed research.

- This can be verified by **Global Warming of 1.5°C (IPCC Special Report, 2018)** on **Unknown page**, where it states: 
  - "CO2 emissions from traffic reduced by 2–3% in Stockholm county. Vehicles entering or leaving the city centre were charged during weekdays (except for holidays). Charges were 1–2€ (maximum 6€ per day), being higher during peak hours; taxis, emergency vehicles and buses were exempted. Before introducing the charge, public transport and parking places near mass transit stations were extended. The aim and effects of the charge were extensively communicated to the public. Acceptability of the congestion charge was initially low, but the scheme gained support of about two-thirds of the population and all political parties after it was implemented (Eliasson, 2014), which may be related to the fact that the revenues were earmarked for constructing a motorway tunnel. After the trial, people believed that the charge had more positive effects on environmental, congestion and parking problems while costs increased less than they anticipated beforehand (Schuitema et al., 2010a). The initially hostile media eventually declared the scheme to be a success."
  - "In 2003, a congestion charge was implemented in the Greater London area, with an enforcement and compliance scheme and an information campaign on the functioning of the scheme. Vehicles entering, leaving, driving or parking on a public road in the zone at weekdays at daytime pay a congestion charge of 8£ (until 2005, 5£), with some exemptions. Revenues were invested in London’s bus network (80%), cycling facilities, and road safety measures (Leape, 2006). The number of cars entering the zone decreased by 18% in 2003 and 2004. In the charging zone, vehicle kilometres driven decreased by 15% in the first year and a further 6% a year later, while CO2 emissions from road traffic reduced by 20% (Santos, 2008)."

    - Text: "The latter can happen when financial incentives reduce a focus on environmental considerations and weaken intrinsic motivation to engage in climate action (Evans et al., 2012; Agrawal et al., 2015; Schwartz et al., 2015). In addition, pursuing small financial gains is perceived to be less worth the effort than pursuing equivalent CO2 emission reductions (Bolderdijk et al., 2013b; Dogan et al., 2014). Also, people may not respond to financial incentives (e.g., to improve energy efficiency) because they do not trust the organization sponsoring incentive programmes (Mundaca, 2007) or when it takes too much effort to receive the incentive (Stern et al., 2016a)."

In Singapore, Stockholm and London, car ownership, car use, and GHG emissions have reduced because of pricing and regulatory policies and policies facilitating behaviour change. Notably, acceptability of these policies has increased as people experienced their positive effects."

- The claim that climate change is a "hoax" is further contradicted by the **IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C**, which provides extensive evidence of the impacts of climate change and the need for urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The report highlights the role of human activities in driving climate change and the importance of mitigating emissions to avoid the worst impacts of global warming.

- The claim that plant photosynthesis is absorbing more CO2 than imagined and thus preventing warming is not supported by the scientific consensus. While plants do absorb CO2, the rate of absorption is not sufficient to counteract the rapid increase in atmospheric CO2 levels caused by human activities. The IPCC report and other scientific studies emphasize the need for significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.
